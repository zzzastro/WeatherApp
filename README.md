Running the WeatherApp Project

To run this WeatherApp project, you'll need to start both the Django backend and the React frontend separately. Here's how:
Backend (Django)

    Activate the virtual environment:

    .\venv\Scripts\activate

    Start the Django development server:

    python manage.py runserver

    This will start the backend server, typically at http://localhost:8000.

Frontend (React)

    Navigate to the frontend directory:

    cd frontend 

    (Note: Replace frontend with the actual name of your React app's directory if it's different.)

    Install dependencies (if you haven't already):

    npm install

    Start the React development server:

    npm start

    This will start the frontend application, which will open in your browser, typically at http://localhost:3000.
